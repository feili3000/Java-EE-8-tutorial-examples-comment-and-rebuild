Most people learn Java EE programming from Java EE tutorial examples, me too. Now I want to dig deeper into them, one by one. I will make some analysis, comments, fix some bugs, and rebuild them.

I will not provide any runnable projects, whatever NetBeans or Eclipse. Instead I provide the rebuild script and YouTube video. You can watch my YouTube video and rebuild by following the script step by step, copy/paste.

You can view all my examples by the [published sequence](PublishSequence.md), the newest on the top, or by [Category](Category.md). They provide the link to the build script and YouTube link for each example.

You can also download everything as a zip file by going to [Java-EE-8-tutorial-examples-comment-and-rebuild](https://github.com/feili3000/Java-EE-8-tutorial-examples-comment-and-rebuild), click [Code], [Download ZIP]. You can start with README.html. It has the link to PublishSequence.html or Category.html, and these 2 html files have the link to the examples.

Enjoy!

Fei Li
