        Most people learn Java EE programming from Java EE tutorial examples, me too. Now I want to dig deeper into them, one by one. I will make some analysis, comments, fix some bugs, make some suggestions and rebuild them.
        <p/>
        I will not provide any runnable projects, whatever NetBeans or Eclipse. Instead I provide the rebuild script and YouTube video. You can watch my YouTube video and rebuild by following the script step by step, copy/paste.
        <p/>
        The best way to follow me is to go to GitHub my project site:<br/>
        <a href="https://github.com/feili3000/Java-EE-8-tutorial-examples-comment-and-rebuild">Java-EE-8-tutorial-examples-comment-and-rebuild</a><br/>
        open README.md, it has the links to PublishSequence.md or Category.md, these 2 files list all the examples, you can choose a example to have look.
        <p/>
        You can also download everything as a zip file by clicking [Code], [Download ZIP]. You can start with README.html. It has the link to<br/>
        <a href="PublishSequence.html">PublishSequence.html</a> or <a href="Category.html">Category.html</a>,<br/> and these 2 html files have the link to the examples.
