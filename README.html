        Most people learn Java EE programming from Java EE Tutorial examples, me too. Now I want to dig deeper into them, one by one. I will make my analysis, comments, fix some bugs, and rebuild them.
        <p/>
        I will not provide any runnable projects, whatever NetBeans or Eclipse. Instead I provide the rebuild script and YouTube link. You can watch my YouTube video and rebuild by following the script step by step, copy/paste.
<p/>
        You can view all my examples by the <a href="web/jsf/RequestScopeBean.md">RequestScopeBean.md</a>  [published sequence](PublishSequence.md), the newest on the top, or by [Category](Category.md). They provide the link to the build script and YouTube link for each example.
<p/>
        You can also download everything as a zip file by going to [Java-EE-8-tutorial-examples-comment-and-rebuild](https://github.com/feili3000/Java-EE-8-tutorial-examples-comment-and-rebuild), click [Code], [Download ZIP]. In your local you can start with README.html to navigate.
<p/>
        Enjoy!
<p/>
